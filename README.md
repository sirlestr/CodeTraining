# CodeTraining

Some of these codes are based on study course on ItNetwork.cz and some on other learning platform, like Udemy,FreeCodeCamp, W3SCool,Microsoft learning etc...

Important notes!!!\
This code I wrote for learning, training and testing new technologies and improve my coding skill and knowledge.

The best techniques are not always used in this codes, like OOP,SRP,SoC etc... The main goal is to learn and practice how things work and how they behave.


some variables are in cz, for better understandig what is going on and for trainig.
In future, larger projects will be in english of course
